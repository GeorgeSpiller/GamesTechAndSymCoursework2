old but i guess still relevent idk
- comenteed out the saving game data process to see if that effected scene 
	transitions
AI (Random and FSM):
	- add an idle animation to make the idle state more obvious?
Gell:
	- fix blue gell on edges keeps increasing jump force
Level Objects:
	- add basic wall of different massed boxes
	- add breaking floor
	- changing mass over time (of player? of object?)
	- more physics materials 

Known Bugs:
	- FSM AI can sometimes stall when transitioning into moveToGelll state,
		potentially due to targetLocation not being valid anymore, freezing
		the AI in place and essentially breaking the moveToGell state.
Level select:
	- dummy levels should not display any text
On Build:
	- cannot press space to play level
